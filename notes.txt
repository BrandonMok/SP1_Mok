- Need to do something with venue since on events it comes back as a number
	- Allowed to get all info at beginning on login?


Figure out what to do with users having same name and password!!

Registrations.php
-> put into URL and do a GET for a specific event


Might want to consider making the header w/nav as a flex layout


Admin.php
	- Table of all users
	- Each row represents one users
	- Add two columns at end w/clickable for edit/delete
	- ADD user option out of table
	- NEED TO DO A REFRESH AFTERWARDS TO SHOW CHANGES
	- HAVE A MSG THAT INFORMS IF SUCESSFUL OR NOT


Who sets the initial role of new users?
