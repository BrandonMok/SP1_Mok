Registrations.php
-> put into URL and do a GET for a specific event
- Have registrations page available
- click on event -> shows sessions -> once choose session then set event registered and session
-- Checks for event exists
-- checks for session exists


To consider:
- When delete an event, delete sessions associated with event
	-- update to attendee_event and attendee_session to delete
	
Delete event
- Delete all sessions
- delete the attendee_event objects
- delete attendee_session objects
- delete manager_event objects

Editing Event:
- Changing venue, make sure that venue exists in the first place
- In event updateEvent function, 


EditPOST
- Look into restructuing so that the data array passed in is like the update,
  so can do all validations and checks in the intended function
  
  
ManagementAddCheck 
- code inside the management pages may be able to use a function to create the table


For the EDIT, might not want to do as a hidden form input bc can see it under dev tools
