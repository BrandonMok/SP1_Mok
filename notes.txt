- Forgot password?? - but security if you can do it to anyone - OR have another table for security questions? -> If get those correct, then can do an UPDATE on account
									
- Have the 'Hi {name}' on header when logged in?

- Navigation
	- show all but deny access?
	- Or only show some?
	- could do a utility function based on role to return a specific header! (might want to ask since he wants sessions)


- Need to do something with venue since on events it comes back as a number
	- Allowed to get all info at beginning on login?


If need to hold current user entire obj, could have function to store entire obj array!!


Figure out what to do with users having same name and password!!!!!!



Registrations.php
-> put into URL and do a GET	


!!Might want to consider making the header w/nav as a flex layout
